# DoorSensor
Uses magnetic Reed switches and Raspberry Pi to play music whenever a door is opened. Great for pranking your colleagues

## What is this?
This is an implementation of a door sensor triggering an event using Raspberry Pi 3B and Reed switches.

## Why is this?
I love tinkering with code. I was looking for a personal project to work on because now I have a lot of time since I WFH and save a lot of time by avoiding commute to work :)

## How can I use this?
I am going to work on taking pictures of my setup (Raspberry Pi + Jumper Cables + Reed Switches) and post it here to paint a pretty picture. In the meanwhile, if you have all
the three ingredients, you can get started. You would need one end of the reed switch to be grounded and another to use one of the GPIO pins. I used pin number 8.
